Build Installer
===============

Build Installer is a Kodi add-on that installs a list of add-ons from their online sources. This add-on facilitates the distribution of Kodi builds as only a list of add-ons and their respective repositories have to be distributed.

Installation
------------

Install Build Installer by going to the Kodi add-ons settings, select "Install from zip file", and select the zip file at ``https://github.com/Flavien/script.buildinstaller/archive/master.zip``.

Instructions
------------

Before using the script, you must create a ``build.xml`` file. The ``build.xml`` file must be placed at the root of your ``userdata`` folder (``%APPDATA%\kodi\userdata`` on Windows, ``~/.kodi/userdata/`` on Linux).

The structure of the ``build.xml`` file is the following:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<addons>
  <addon id="[addon_1]" />
  <addon id="[addon_2]" />
  ...
</addons>
```

For example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<addons>
  <addon id="metadata.universal" />
  <addon id="plugin.video.youtube" />
  <addon id="service.subtitles.opensubtitles" />
  <addon id="weather.yahoo" />
  <addon id="skin.eminence.2" />
</addons>
```

The add-on repositories from which the add-ons should be fetched must be installed and enabled for the installation process to work.

Once the ``build.xml`` file has been created, simply execute the Build Installer program to launch the installation process.
